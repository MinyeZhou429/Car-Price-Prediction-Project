### Main Finding

-   enginesize is the most powerful predictor for car price
-   Random Forest model has the best performance based on the R-square
-   parametric models are preferred for this dataset

### Limitation

-   Excluding categorical data may decrease the model performance since they could provide some important information like car body, drive wheel, and engine type
-   Small testing set size may potentially cause the large difference of R-square between testing set and training set

### Future Direction

-   car price could be transformed into categorical variable so that classification algorithms could be applied
-   Perform feature engineering
-   The model could be tested on larger dataset to increase its generalizability

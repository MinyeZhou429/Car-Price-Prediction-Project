# BST260 Final Project: Car Price Prediction Models

## Introduction
### Data Source

*Automobile Data Set* from UCI Machine Learning Repository (DIM: 26 x 205)

### Outcome and Variable used in analyses

The dependent variable is car price, the car price distribution is as followed:

| Mean | 25 percentile | Median | 75 percentile | Maximum |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| $5118 | $7788 | $10295 | $16503 | $45400 |

The covariates used in the study are:

| Variable name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| symbolling | Its assigned insurance risk rating, A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.(Categorical)  |
| wheelbase | Weelbase of car (Numeric) |
| carlength |  Length of car (Numeric) |
| carwidth | Width of car (Numeric) |
| carheight | height of car (Numeric) |
| curbweight | The weight of a car without occupants or baggage. (Numeric) |
| enginesize | Size of car (Numeric) |
| boreratio | Boreratio of car (Numeric) |
| stroke | Stroke or volume inside the engine (Numeric) |
| compressionratio | compression ratio of car (Numeric) |
| horsepower | Horsepower (Numeric) |
| peakrpm | car peak rpm (Numeric) |
| citympg | Mileage in city (Numeric) |
| highwaympg | Mileage on highway (Numeric) |

### Goal

- Find powerful predictors of car price
- Construct accurate prediction models for car price
- Compare model performance

### Correlation Analysis
